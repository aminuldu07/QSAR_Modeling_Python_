# pubchem. inchikey.Initial processing of the csv file ("merged_on_Approval_ID.csv") for getting unique INCHIKEY/SMILES.
     Deleting duplicate INCHIKEY from the "merged_on_Approval_ID.csv". unique_inchikeys. 

  # Checking the effectiveness of deleting duplicate INCHIKEY by agian deleting the duplicate SMILES values and
    checking the differnce between these two files (two files should be identical). unique_smiles

  # Generating files containing finally selected SMILES from "U_SMILES.csv" and SMILES and INCHIKEY from 
    the "unique_inchikeys.csv". "SMILES = SMILES1". # Select the desired columns- 
    result_df = merged_df[['SMILES1', 'SMILES', 'INCHIKEY']]

  # Convert the INCHIKEY to inchi string using pubchempy package 


2. Add the descriptors name as the column name 


3. @@@ Molecular descriptors from sdf file @@ 
   Create single sdf file from the master sdf file. remove the leading "$$$$" from each sdf file.
   using pandas & rdkit packages, match the each smile string from "U_SMILES.csv" with the each sdf
   file. The matched sdf file will be copied at new folder named "sdftosmile". Now, calculate the 
   molecular descriptors for these sdf file using rdkit as well as mordred package.
